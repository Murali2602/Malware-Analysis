## Introduction

We can't get a lot of information about the malware and its doings by just performing static analysis. Dynamic analysis gives way more information since the malware is actually doing its thing and we could analyse it in real time. What if the malware was reaching out to an URL? You can catch it with Wireshark, what if it was creating Processes? You can catch it with Procmon and so on and this is why Dynamic Analysis can be so important.

##### INETSIM 

Inetsim is a Internet Simulator and we have this on REMnux VM and this can be used to emulate the "Internet" as a lot of malwares require internet to execute properly and if there is no internet or atleast a simulation it wont perform its thing and we wont be able to analyse anything.

##### Wireshark

Start wireshark too on REMnux for real-time network analysis and we can use this for identifying the sites that the malware might be trying to reach and what it might be downloading.

**Example:** We will run the **Malware_Unknown.exe** and then we know that its trying to reach to a site to get a favicon file so we will use this filter on wireshark and see if we can find it.
This is a ***Network Signature.***

## Procmon

This is a very important tool, this tool essentially shows everything that is happening in the system. The most important or crucial feature in this is the ***Filter*** option which lets us filter out the Malware from legit processes and a huge list.
So like we can set a filter and then run our Malware and then see what happened.

Now when we run the Malware we should see only stuff related to Process Name of that Malware

You can right click on a thing and add it to filter too like ***CreateFile***
